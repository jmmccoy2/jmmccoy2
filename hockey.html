        <p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">One of the biggest constants through Jonathan's life has been hockey. He has been playing hockey since elementary school and has even went to the ER becasue of it. When he was in 3rd grade he fell on a hockey skate while playing bumper butts and sliced open the are below his mouth. This resulted in him having to get two layers of dissolvable stitches, and gave him a cool story. </p>
